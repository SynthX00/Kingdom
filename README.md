# Kingdom

Kingdom is a small building expansion game made with the Unity Engine during my 2nd year of college, where the main objective is to build and earn score points!

## Finished Game

During the game you have to manage your resources, create new buildings and expand your empire! <br />
By doing so you'll be rewarded by some juicy points for your SCORE! :)

# Development

As said before this project was developed with the Unity Engine v5.6. <br />
The main feature I focused on while creating the game was making the word entirely randomly generated.

All the programming and visual assets were made by me. The music and soundfx came from external sources.

# Controls 
### (if you decide to download and try the game)

The entire game is controlled with the mouse... oh and Escape.
